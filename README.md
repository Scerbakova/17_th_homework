I have created this Rick and Morty app, which has different routes. Homepage contains the video with one of the best moment, Characters page contains all characters with infinite scroll. There is also "read more" button for every character which redirects you to single character page. The same is happening in episodes and locations. In addition episaodes page has a search bar. App is responsive.
There is a possibility to switch themes from ligth to dark.
